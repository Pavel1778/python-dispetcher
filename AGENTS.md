# AGENTS.md

## What this repository is

`/workspace/platform` is the durable control plane for orchestrating OpenHands
agent conversations. It owns task state, leases, assignment and recovery.
It does not own the runtime: conversations execute in the OpenHands
agent-server.

## Layout

- `orchestration/control_plane.py` — SQLite task store: `submit_task`,
  `claim_task`, `transition`, `reclaim_expired`, `bind_conversation`,
  `set_result`. Enforces the state machine in `_ALLOWED`.
- `orchestration/openhands_client.py` — stdlib-only REST adapter for the
  agent-server. No external dependencies, on purpose.
- `orchestration/dispatcher.py` — one tick = reconcile → recover → advance →
  dispatch. This is the only place that decides task state from runtime
  signals.
- `INTEGRATION-MAP.md` — every confirmed API fact. Read it before changing the
  adapter.
- `tests/fake_runtime.py` — a real local HTTP server speaking the confirmed
  v1.50.1 surface. Tests use it, not mocks of the client.
- `tests/e2e_*.py` — manual scripts against the real runtime. Not collected by
  pytest (`python_files = test_*.py`).

## Commands

```bash
# Tests (needs the venv that has pytest; the system python does not)
/workspace/project/4119041ca5254315a7b6e95fdc85ae8a/scratch/sdk-main/.venv/bin/python \
  -m pytest tests/ -q -p no:cacheprovider

# Manual end-to-end against the live runtime (creates and deletes its own
# conversation; the three long-lived conversations are never touched)
/workspace/project/4119041ca5254315a7b6e95fdc85ae8a/scratch/sdk-main/.venv/bin/python \
  tests/e2e_dispatcher_loop.py
```

## Runtime facts that cost real debugging to learn

These were found by running against the live server, not from docs:

1. **`agent_settings` is required on create.** Without it: `422 ... One of
   agent, agent_settings, or agent_profile_id must be provided`. The dispatcher
   fetches it from `GET /api/settings` once and forwards it, so it never needs
   to hold an LLM key.
2. **Creation is idempotent only if you supply `conversation_id`.** The
   dispatcher derives it with `task_conversation_id()` (uuid5 of the task id).
   A restart then gets `200` and the existing conversation, not a duplicate.
   Do not switch to a random uuid without replacing the recovery logic.
3. **`?kind=ConversationErrorEvent` on `events/search` returns nothing** even
   when the event exists. Fetch unfiltered and match `classification` on the
   client.
4. **`GET /api/conversations/{id}/events` needs a body** and returns 422
   otherwise; use `/events/search` or `/events/count`.
5. **The runtime classifies its own failures.** `classification.retryable` is
   authoritative: `false` means retrying cannot succeed, so the task is
   dead-lettered at once. Do not retry auth/config errors.
6. **`POST /run` returning 409 means already running**, which is success.

## Invariants to keep

- A missing answer is never completion. `finished` with an empty final response
  is `blocked`, not `completed`.
- A transport error keeps the lease and does not increment `attempt`.
- One action per task per tick (`_touched`). Without it a persistently failing
  task spins inside a single tick.
- The API key is read from the environment and never logged.

## Environment note

The runtime at `127.0.0.1:60000` in this sandbox has **no working LLM key**
(auth fails). That is why the e2e scripts assert the dead-letter path. A
successful-completion e2e needs a valid key and is not yet exercised.
